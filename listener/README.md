This directory contains files to start a docker container
that will listen for thermal camera input and runs an image parsing model on
it, pumping back out bounding boxes for critical information found within the
video (frame by frame). This takes input from another container or source
that connects to internal port 8000. The input should be video data coming
from a thermal camera as this directory contains a trained model.

The image generated by this dockerfile is exported and in the base directory of
this project.
